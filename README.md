## Simplified block diagram
![](https://github.com/vankxr/icyradio/blob/v1/ssb-mod/docs/block-diagram.png)  
#### v1/ssb-mod
This branch implements a **S**ingle **S**ide **B**and audio modulator, optimized for the QO-100 narrowband transponder.
It implements a pre-emphasis filter to allow better SNR at audio high frequencies and general audio power spectral distribution

## Dependencies
 - [icestorm](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm) - FPGA toolchain
 - [arm-none-eabi-gcc](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) - MCUs toolchain
 - [Device CMSIS](https://www.keil.com/dd2/) - CMSIS headers defining the MCU memories, peripherals, etc...
 - [Core CMSIS](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) - CMSIS headers defining the ARM Cores
 - [armmem](https://github.com/vankxr/armmem) - ELF file analyzer (required for the MCU Makefiles to work)

## Errata
 - Microchip DS12x1 has the wrong package in the PCB version that was sent for manufacturing. The package in the datasheet has the pins wrongly named clockwise.
 - The oscillators used have a drift of +-20ppm. While this is good for broadcast FM demodulation, for example, it is really high for transmitting narrow band signals above ~300MHz, and one can easily hear the drift when transmitting audio. Two +-0.5ppm TCXOs were deadbugged in place for the ADF4351 and R820T2 references.
 - The DAC common mode pins were not connected in the PCB version that was sent for manufacturing. Solution was to scrape a bit of the GND plane and solder the pins to it.
 - Other minor hardware errata such as drop-in component replacement (i.e. filter tuning) is not stated here, view the schematic history.
