## Simplified block diagram
![](https://github.com/vankxr/icyradio/blob/master/docs/block-diagram.png)  
#### master
The **master** branch is where everything starts. It contains a simple broadcast FM demodulator. It is not optimized at all. The stereo is not really good and the RDS data is not demodulated (yet).

## Dependencies
 - [icestorm](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm) - FPGA toolchain
 - [arm-none-eabi-gcc](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) - MCUs toolchain
 - [Device CMSIS](https://www.keil.com/dd2/) - CMSIS headers defining the MCU memories, peripherals, etc...
 - [Core CMSIS](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) - CMSIS headers defining the ARM Cores
 - [armmem](https://github.com/vankxr/armmem) - ELF file analyzer (required for the MCU Makefiles to work)

## Errata
 - Microchip DS12x1 has the wrong package in the PCB version that was sent for manufacturing. The package in the datasheet has the pins wrongly named clockwise.
 - The oscillators used have a drift of +-20ppm, this is really high for transmitting narrow band signals above ~300MHz, and can easily be heard. A +-0.5ppm oscillator was deadbugged in place for the ADF4351 reference.
 - The DAC common mode pins were not connected in the PCB version that was sent for manufacturing. Solution was to scrape a bit of the GND plane and solder the pins to it.
